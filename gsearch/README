gsearch is a crawler that searches for files larger than a given 
size in a particular web site. gsearch uses GoogleAPI in order to 
search the web for several types of files (pdf, ps, doc, etc) 
and returns the url of the files that satisfy the given parameters.

Usage:
./gsearch.pl -v [-w writefile] [-r readfile] [-s size] [server]
        -v: verbose
        -w: write results to file <writefile>
        -r: read server(s) from file <readfile>
                 file format: <server>\n
        if readfile is not provided then server name is needed

        -s: limiting results to files greater than size bytes (default = 100KB)

In order to use GoogleAPI anyone must give a license key provided by google.
We provide a valid license key inside gsearch.
If you want to create and use your own key, please visit:

DEPENDENCIES:
gsearch needs SOAP-Lite. Run "./configure" to be sure that it exists in your system.
If this package is not present, then you have to install it.
If you use a linux distribution like debian, then you need to install the
package "libsoap-lite-perl" (e.g. apt-get install libsoap-lite-perl).
Else, you can install it using "perl -MCPAN -e 'install SOAP::Lite'" 
(if you already have CPAN.pm installed). 
Or you can download it from "http://search.cpan.org/".
